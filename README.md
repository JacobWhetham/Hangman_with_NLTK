# Hangman_with_NLTK
This is a simple gamified project to get used to basic functionality in the Natural Language Toolkit. This project takes the form of a Hangman game, but the words are randomly selected through the NLTK.

### What is Hangman?
Hangman is a simple game often played in grade school. One person selects a word and draws an underscore for each character in the word. The rest of the players take turns guessing the letters within the word. For every incorrect guess, an appendage is drawn to represent a human. When the appendages form a complete human, the other players lose the game. If a correct guess is made, any placeholder underscores are replaced with the letter.

### Project Dependencies
* Python 3.8.
* nltk.
* random.
* The NLTK library will automatically download the respective "Word" and "WordNet" files used in the program.
